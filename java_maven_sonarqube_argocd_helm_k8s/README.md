# Jenkins Pipeline for Java based application using Maven, SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm and Kubernetes


CI/CD Pipeline for Java Applications

This guide outlines the implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for deploying a Java application using Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Helm, and Kubernetes, with Argo CD for production promotion.


---

Prerequisites

1. Source Code: Java application hosted in a Git repository.


2. Jenkins Server: Installed and configured.


3. Kubernetes Cluster: Deployed and accessible.


4. Helm: Installed for package management.


5. Argo CD: Configured for deployment.




---

Key Components

Jenkins Plugins

Git Plugin: For source code checkout.

Maven Integration Plugin: To build and package the application.

JUnit and Mockito Plugins: For unit testing.

SonarQube Plugin: For static code analysis.

Kubernetes Continuous Deploy Plugin: To deploy the application using Helm.



---

Pipeline Workflow

1. Source Code Checkout

Fetch the latest code from the Git repository.



2. Build Java Application

Compile and build the application using Maven.



3. Run Unit Tests

Execute unit tests with JUnit and Mockito to ensure code correctness.



4. Code Quality Analysis

Perform static code analysis using SonarQube to ensure code adheres to quality standards.



5. Package Application

Create a JAR file for the application.



6. Deploy to Test Environment

Use Helm to deploy the application to a Kubernetes test environment.



7. Acceptance Testing

Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application to validate functionality.



8. Promote to Production

Use Argo CD to synchronize the application to the production environment.





---

Setup

1. Jenkins Configuration

Create a pipeline job and configure it to pull from your Git repository.

Add environment variables and credentials for SonarQube and Kubernetes.


2. Helm Chart Preparation

Develop a Helm chart for the application with Kubernetes manifests for deployment, service, and configurations.


3. SonarQube Integration

Configure SonarQube in Jenkins to analyze the Java application during the build process.


4. Argo CD Setup

Install and configure Argo CD on your Kubernetes cluster.

Link it to the Git repository containing your Helm chart.



---

Deployment Steps

1. Trigger the Jenkins Pipeline

Start the pipeline to initiate the build, test, and deployment process.



2. Monitor Stages

Verify each stage for successful completion in Jenkins.



3. Deploy to Production

Confirm the final deployment to the production environment via Argo CD.

This pipeline streamlines the CI/CD process for Java applications, enabling automated builds, quality checks, and seamless deployments to Kubernetes environments.
