# CI-CD-Pipeline-Automation
This repository contains the source code for a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline built with Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Argo CD. The pipeline automates deployment processes to ensure zero downtime and continuous delivery. It integrates testing, deployment strategies, and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana for performance tracking.

This repository contains the implementation of a complete CI/CD pipeline for automated application deployment, continuous integration, and continuous delivery using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Argo CD, Prometheus, and Grafana. The goal is to streamline the application deployment process, achieve zero downtime, improve code quality with automated testing, and allow for continuous delivery with built-in monitoring.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end CI/CD pipeline that automates the build, test, deployment, and monitoring processes. The pipeline is designed to reduce the time between code commit and deployment to production by automating every step of the delivery process.

- Jenkins: For continuous integration and managing the automation pipeline.
- Docker: Used for containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across environments.
- Kubernetes: Manages containerized applications across multiple hosts, enabling auto-scaling and ensuring availability.
- Argo CD: Manages continuous delivery by syncing Kubernetes resources with the repository.
- Prometheus: Collects metrics to monitor the health and performance of the application.
- Grafana: Visualizes the metrics and logs for better monitoring and alerting.

## Technologies Used
- Jenkins: Automates build, testing, and deployment tasks.
- Docker: Containerizes applications for consistency and scalability.
- Kubernetes: Orchestrates and scales containers across clusters.
- Argo CD: Provides GitOps for continuous delivery.
- Prometheus: Monitors metrics in real-time.
- Grafana: Visualizes Prometheus data with custom dashboards.
- GitHub: Source control for the repository and webhooks for triggering Jenkins pipelines.

## Key Features
- Automated Testing: Automatically runs tests before every deployment.
- Continuous Deployment: Ensures that every change to the codebase is automatically deployed to production.
- Zero Downtime: Uses Kubernetes for rolling updates to prevent downtime during deployments.
- Monitoring: Prometheus collects metrics on application performance, and Grafana visualizes them in real-time.
- GitOps with Argo CD: Ensures that Kubernetes configurations are automatically applied from the Git repository.
  
## System Architecture

Source Code -> GitHub -> Jenkins -> Docker -> Kubernetes Cluster -> Argo CD -> Prometheus -> Grafana (Monitoring)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local system or a cloud environment.
`bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CI-CD-Pipeline-Automation.git
cd CI-CD-Pipeline-Automation

## 2. Set up Jenkins

1. Install Jenkins (Jenkins 2.x recommended).


2. Install the following plugins:

Docker

Kubernetes

GitHub Integration

Prometheus

Argo CD

Set up Jenkins with the necessary configurations:

Link Jenkins to your GitHub repository.

Configure webhooks in GitHub to trigger Jenkins builds on commits.

Create Jenkins jobs for:

Build: To build Docker images.

Test: To run unit tests.

Deploy: To deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.





## 3. Docker Setup

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on the system where Jenkins will build the Docker image.


2. Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project if not already provided.


3. Configure Jenkins to build the Docker image using this Dockerfile and push it to your preferred Docker registry (e.g., DockerHub, Amazon ECR).



## 4. Kubernetes Setup

1. Set up a Kubernetes cluster (local, cloud-based, or managed like Google Kubernetes Engine or Amazon EKS).

2. Install kubectl and configure it to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster.

3. Set up Kubernetes deployment manifests and deploy your application using Argo CD for continuous delivery.


## 5. Monitoring Setup (Prometheus & Grafana)

1. Install Prometheus to monitor the Kubernetes cluster.


2. Set up Grafana and connect it to Prometheus for real-time monitoring dashboards.


3. Configure Prometheus to collect custom application metrics, such as response times and error rates.



## How to Use

1. Once Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and Prometheus are set up, push changes to the GitHub repository.


2. The changes will trigger the Jenkins pipeline, which will:

Build the Docker image.

Run the tests.

Deploy the application to Kubernetes.


3. Check Prometheus for metrics and Grafana for dashboards showing your application's health.
